# Theme: dirssi                   
# Author: Mauro Crociara (realnot)
# Version: dirsi-0.150710-r1
# Last update: Jul 10 2015
# Description: a full customizable dark irssi theme. This version use the 
# hex format for the colors. To display it in a properly way, you need to set
# colors_ansi_24bit on. Take a look here:
# https://github.com/shabble/irssi-docs/wiki/Irssi-0.8.17#Testing_true_colours
#
# If you can't use true colours for some reason, there are two other version
# of this theme: dirssi16 and dirssi256 that provide the support rispectively 
# for 16 and 256 colors.
#
# Feel free to modify everything and enjoy the theme :)
